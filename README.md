AI-Driven Job Order System with Analytics and Recommendation Features for Galit Digital Printing Services
📌 Project Description
 Galit Digital Printing Services in Lobo, Batangas processes around 2,000 orders monthly, offering services such as tarpaulin printing, custom apparel, signage, event giveaways, billboards, and sintraboard. Currently, the shop relies on handwritten logs and outdated spreadsheets, resulting in inefficiencies, delays, and customer dissatisfaction.
This project introduces an AI-driven, web-based Job Order Management System prototype designed for admin use only. The system includes real-time order tracking (simulation), dashboard analytics, and AI-powered recommendation placeholders for improved order handling and resource planning.
As this is a UI/UX prototype, there is no backend or database integration — data is simulated using static JSON objects for demonstration purposes.

🎯 Problem Statement
The current workflow of Galit Digital Printing Services lacks structure, resulting in frequent errors and poor visibility of job orders and inventory status.
The proposed system solves this by offering:
A centralized dashboard for job orders and inventory overview.


Simulated real-time job status tracking.


AI analytics placeholders for future decision-making and trend analysis.



✅ Objectives
Develop an admin web interface for managing job orders.


Create a dashboard prototype for viewing workload and inventory summaries.


Integrate AI-powered recommendations (UI placeholder) for scheduling and resource allocation.


Ensure the interface is responsive and easy to navigate, even without backend functionality.
